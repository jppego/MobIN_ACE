# MobIN_ACE
Automated Google Form for learning agreement changes requests

# Introduction
This was one of my first big projects.
I worked as ERAMUS local coordinator for my faculty, one of 14 of the university. The incoming mobility students could propose learning agreements including course units from all programmes and faculties of the university.  At the faculty level there was a mobility coordinator for each programme, which was responsible for analysing incoming and outgoing mobility processes. 

Upon arrival, incoming mobility students needed to make changes to the learning agreements using our information system. Once the change to the learning agreement (ACE in the Portuguese acronym) request was submitted only the university's international relations office (IRO) was able to reopen it. To avoid too many interactions, the faculty's IRO asked students to validate the changes with the programme mobility coordinators before submitting the ACE request in the information system. Initially, this process would use email or personal contact, which was tiresome and inefficient. 

# Project description
I developed a Google Form which would collect all the change requests of a student (deletion/addition of course units) and send the requests to each programme mobility coordinator per email. The Google Form was fead by an auxiliar Google Sheet.
