# MobIN_ACE
Automated Google Form for learning agreement changes requests

# Introduction
This was one of my first big projects.
I worked as ERAMUS local coordinator for my faculty. Incoming mobility students needed to make changes to the learning agreements using our information system. Once the change to the learning agreement (ACE in the Portuguese acronym) request was submitted only the university's international relations office was able to reopen it.
